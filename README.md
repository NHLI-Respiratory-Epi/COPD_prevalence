[^1]: The [Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-collections/quality-and-outcomes-framework-qof) is a primary care pay-for-performance scheme. General practices receive points for completing specific items of care within a certain timeframe. The proportion of maximum possible points received in a year determines the size of financial bonus received at the end of the year.
