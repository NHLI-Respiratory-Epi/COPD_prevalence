# COPD prevalence Stata scripts

## [Build scripts](build_scripts/)
This folder contains the code to take the raw extract received from CPRD and generate the dataset necessary to calculate COPD prevalence. Run the Stata `.do` files in numeric order. The following Stata commands are required to run this code:
- [`cprddate`](https://github.com/pstone22/cprddate)
- [`cprdlabel`](https://github.com/pstone22/cprdlabel)

## [Analysis scripts](analysis_scripts/)
This folder contains the code to generate the prevalence plots using the dataset generated by the `build_scripts`. Run the Stata `.do` files in numeric order. The Stata [`schemepack`](https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-schemepack) package by Asjad Naqvi is required for the graph colour schemes.
